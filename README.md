### Leeland Miller
##### Full Stack Web Development Portfolio

<hr/>

I developed my portfolio with the idea that my portfolio should be a project within my portfolio itself.

So I applied my knowledge and skills to create my portfolio as a full stack web app.

When the portfolio is complete, it will allow me to login as the [sole] user, to then add, edit, or delete my projects.

It will also allow visitors to rate my projects on a 1-5 star rating system, and/or potentially provide feedback via an anonymous comment submission.
